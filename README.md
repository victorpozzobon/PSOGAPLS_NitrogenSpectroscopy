# Particle Swarm & Genetic Algorithm Optimizer associated with Partial Least Square for nitrate and nitrite spectroscopic quantification 

Repository hosting the Python codes and data associated with the article: 
[Nitrate and nitrite as mixed source of nitrogen for Chlorella vulgaris: fast nitrogen quantification using spectrophotometer and machine learning.](https://www.springer.com/journal/10811) 
Pozzobon, V., Levasseur, W., Guerin, C. & Perre, P. (2021). 
*Journal of Applied Phycology*, 1-9. [(Preprint)](https://victorpozzobon.github.io/assets/preprints/Pozzobon_2021_b.pdf)

It has been tested sucessfully on July 2021.

WORK IN PROGRESS !!!!!!!

## Structure

You can find the solver to compile in the *simpleThermFoam_solver* folder.
The associated tutorial can be found in *simpleThermFoam_tutorial/heatTransferSingleSphere*. It features a single sphere and the surrounding flow. The sphere exprience a temperature dependent heat realease that heats it up as well as the sweeping air.  
Please note that this example is a simplication of the case presented in the article. Its sole purpose is to run on a desktop (still in parallel) so that you can try it.
